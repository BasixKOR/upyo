SMTP
====

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is the standard protocol for sending emails
across networks, as defined in [RFC 5321].  Most email providers offer SMTP
servers alongside their proprietary APIs, making SMTP a universal fallback
option when specific transports aren't available for your email provider.
The SMTP protocol provides reliable, widely-supported email delivery with
features like authentication, encryption, and delivery confirmation.

Upyo provides a comprehensive SMTP transport through the *@upyo/smtp* package,
offering connection pooling, TLS support, multiple authentication methods,
and efficient bulk sending capabilities.

[RFC 5321]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5321


Installation
------------

To use the SMTP transport, you need to install the *@upyo/smtp* package:

::: code-group

~~~~ sh [npm]
npm add @upyo/smtp
~~~~

~~~~ sh [pnpm]
pnpm add @upyo/smtp
~~~~

~~~~ sh [Yarn]
yarn add @upyo/smtp
~~~~

~~~~ sh [Deno]
deno add jsr:@upyo/smtp
~~~~

~~~~ sh [Bun]
bun add @upyo/smtp
~~~~

:::


Basic usage
-----------

The SMTP transport requires connection details for your SMTP server,
including the hostname, port, and authentication credentials.
Most email providers offer SMTP access through their settings or
developer documentation.

~~~~ typescript twoslash
import { SmtpTransport } from "@upyo/smtp";
import { createMessage } from "@upyo/core";

// Create transport with basic configuration
const transport = new SmtpTransport({
  host: "smtp.gmail.com",
  port: 465,
  secure: true,
  auth: {
    user: "your-email@gmail.com",
    pass: "your-app-password",
  },
});

const message = createMessage({
  from: "sender@example.com",
  to: "recipient@example.com",
  subject: "Hello from Upyo SMTP",
  content: { text: "This email was sent using the SMTP transport." },
});

const receipt = await transport.send(message);
if (receipt.successful) {
  console.log("Message sent with ID:", receipt.messageId);
} else {
  console.error("Send failed:", receipt.errorMessages.join(", "));
}

// Clean up connections when done
await transport.closeAllConnections();
~~~~

The transport automatically handles connection management, protocol negotiation,
and message formatting. When you're finished sending emails, it's important to
close connections to free up resources.


Automatic resource management
-----------------------------

Modern JavaScript environments support automatic resource cleanup using
the [`await using`] statement, which automatically closes SMTP connections
when the transport goes out of scope:

~~~~ typescript twoslash
import { SmtpTransport } from "@upyo/smtp";
import { createMessage } from "@upyo/core";

await using transport = new SmtpTransport({
  host: "smtp.example.com",
  port: 587,
  secure: false,
  auth: {
    user: "username",
    pass: "password",
  },
});

const message = createMessage({
  from: "system@example.com",
  to: "user@example.com",
  subject: "System Notification",
  content: { text: "Your backup completed successfully." },
});

await transport.send(message);
// Connections are automatically closed when transport goes out of scope
~~~~

This approach eliminates the need to manually call
`~SmtpTransport.closeAllConnections()` and ensures proper cleanup
even if errors occur.

Connection configuration
------------------------

The SMTP transport offers extensive configuration options to work with different
email providers and security requirements.  Connection settings control
timeouts, pooling, and protocol behavior:

~~~~ typescript twoslash
import { SmtpTransport } from "@upyo/smtp";

const transport = new SmtpTransport({
  host: "mail.example.com",
  port: 587,
  secure: false,
  auth: {
    user: "user@example.com",
    pass: "secure-password",
    method: "plain",
  },
  connectionTimeout: 30000,
  socketTimeout: 60000,
  localName: "mail.mycompany.com",
  pool: true,
  poolSize: 10,
});
~~~~

The `~SmtpConfig.host` and `~SmtpConfig.port` specify your SMTP server details,
while `~SmtpConfig.secure` determines whether to use TLS encryption.
Connection and socket timeouts prevent hanging connections,
and the `~SmtpConfig.localName` identifies your server during
the SMTP handshake.  Connection pooling improves performance by reusing
connections across multiple messages.


Authentication methods
----------------------

The SMTP transport supports multiple authentication mechanisms commonly used by
email providers.  The most widely supported method is PLAIN authentication,
which works with virtually all SMTP servers:

~~~~ typescript twoslash
import { SmtpTransport } from "@upyo/smtp";

// PLAIN authentication (most common)
const gmailTransport = new SmtpTransport({
  host: "smtp.gmail.com",
  port: 465,
  secure: true,
  auth: {
    user: "your-email@gmail.com",
    pass: "your-app-password",
    method: "plain",
  },
});

// LOGIN authentication for older servers
const outlookTransport = new SmtpTransport({
  host: "smtp-mail.outlook.com",
  port: 587,
  secure: false,
  auth: {
    user: "your-email@outlook.com",
    pass: "your-password",
    method: "login",
  },
});
~~~~

When using services like Gmail, you'll need to generate an app-specific password
rather than using your regular account password.  The transport automatically
detects server capabilities and chooses the appropriate authentication method
if you don't specify one.


TLS and security configuration
------------------------------

Security is crucial for email transmission, and the SMTP transport provides
comprehensive TLS configuration options.  You can control encryption,
certificate validation, and TLS protocol versions:

~~~~ typescript twoslash
import { SmtpTransport } from "@upyo/smtp";

const transport = new SmtpTransport({
  host: "secure-smtp.example.com",
  port: 465,
  secure: true,
  auth: {
    user: "secure@example.com",
    pass: "password",
  },
  tls: {
    rejectUnauthorized: true,
    minVersion: "TLSv1.2",
    maxVersion: "TLSv1.3",
    ca: ["-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n..."],
  },
});
~~~~

Setting `secure: true` establishes a TLS connection from the start,
while `rejectUnauthorized: true` ensures certificate validation.
You can specify custom certificate authorities, client certificates,
and acceptable TLS versions based on your security requirements.

> [!CAUTION]
> The SMTP transport does not currently support STARTTLS (upgrading from plain
> to encrypted connections).  You must use direct TLS connections by setting
> `secure: true` and using the appropriate secure port (typically 465)
> for encrypted email transmission.


Bulk email sending
------------------

For sending multiple emails efficiently, the SMTP transport provides
a `~SmtpTransport.sendMany()` method that reuses connections and handles errors
gracefully.  This approach is much more efficient than
calling `~SmtpTransport.send()` multiple times:

~~~~ typescript twoslash
import { SmtpTransport } from "@upyo/smtp";
import { createMessage } from "@upyo/core";

await using transport = new SmtpTransport({
  host: "smtp.example.com",
  port: 587,
  secure: false,
  auth: {
    user: "bulk@example.com",
    pass: "password",
  },
  poolSize: 5,
});

const messages = [
  createMessage({
    from: "newsletter@example.com",
    to: "subscriber1@example.com",
    subject: "Weekly Newsletter #1",
    content: { text: "Welcome to our newsletter!" },
  }),
  createMessage({
    from: "newsletter@example.com",
    to: "subscriber2@example.com",
    subject: "Weekly Newsletter #2",
    content: { text: "Thank you for subscribing!" },
  }),
];

for await (const receipt of transport.sendMany(messages)) {
  if (receipt.successful) {
    console.log(`Message ${receipt.messageId} sent successfully`);
  } else {
    console.error(`Failed to send message: ${receipt.errorMessages.join(", ")}`);
  }
}
~~~~

The `~SmtpTransport.sendMany()` method processes messages sequentially,
providing individual receipts for each message.  Connection pooling ensures
efficient resource usage, and failed messages don't prevent subsequent messages
from being sent.


Development and testing
-----------------------

For local development and testing, you can use development SMTP servers or
configure the transport for testing environments.  The package supports various
testing scenarios including mock servers:

~~~~ typescript twoslash
import { SmtpTransport } from "@upyo/smtp";

// Local development with Mailpit (popular SMTP testing tool)
const devTransport = new SmtpTransport({
  host: "localhost",
  port: 1025,
  secure: false,
  // No authentication needed for local testing
});

// Testing configuration with relaxed security
const testTransport = new SmtpTransport({
  host: "test-smtp.example.com",
  port: 587,
  secure: false,
  auth: {
    user: "test@example.com",
    pass: "test-password",
  },
  tls: {
    rejectUnauthorized: false, // For self-signed certificates in test environments
  },
  connectionTimeout: 5000, // Shorter timeouts for faster test feedback
});
~~~~

> [!TIP]
>  [Mailpit] is an excellent development SMTP server that provides a modern

> that accepts all emails but doesn't deliver them, instead storing them
> locally for inspection.  Mailpit offers features like HTML and plain text
> email viewing, attachment downloads, search functionality, and even webhook
> testing for email events.
>
> You can install Mailpit as a standalone binary, run it via Docker,
